# the-shining-light-in-the-darkness
a 2 months journey about learning kaggel from 26/07/2025 to 26/9/2025 

# Project: الضوء المضيئ في الظلمة (The Illuminating Light in the Darkness)

> A public chronicle of my journey into the world of data science and machine learning through Kaggle. This repository serves as my digital workshop and research journal.

## Vision

This project is an application of the "Scientist of the Self" protocol, where the process of learning is documented as an experiment. The "darkness" is the unknown of complex subjects, and the "light" is the insight gained through rigorous study and practice.

## Journey Structure

This repository is organized by Kaggle competitions or major learning topics. Each major folder will contain its own notebooks, scripts, and a specific README detailing the process for that challenge.

* **Current Focus:** [Name of the current Kaggle competition, e.g., "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"]
* **Next Up:** [Name of the next planned competition or topic]

## Tech Stack

* Python 3.11
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebooks
